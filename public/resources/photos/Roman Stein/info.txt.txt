Hello,

until now it is very hard for me to believe that Juriaan is not existing any more. I am not using Facebook, but my sister Anna told me about this unbelievable terrible news. Even if i will not be at the funeral, i will always remember Juri as a very open lovable person. He helped me to be more open for things which cannot be explained logically. And i am sure, that if there are some things in the future, i cannot explain, i will remember him. Anna told me that you collect some photos from Juri, so i will send you some.
I met Juri 4 times in my live. 2 times i took some pictures.

2004: Me and my sister met Juri the first time in San Martin de los Andes in Argentina, where we did together a trek for a couple of days. We had some trouble to find the way and nearly got lost. If i would have done this trekking only with my sister, we would have had a dispute the whole time. With Juri the situation was more peaceful.
2015: Last year at Christmas Juri visited me and stayed at my house for one week. I was very grateful that he visited me, because i had a very hard year. We had some nice days together and a lot of fun. The picture shows Juri with a friend of mine in a bar in Munich.

With love, deep sorrow and sympathy
