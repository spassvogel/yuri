What a sad thing to read. I met Yuri on 'praya the pipa' Brazil. we spend such a good time together , once we went lost on the way to the beach , we were laughing, singing and shared maybe some off the joyful moments in my journey . Last year he came to Jordan and wrote me he might come for a visit, unfortunately he didn't. Yuri was one of this people I could feel I miss love and feel like he is a good friend despite off the fact we didn't met each other for 10 years. I'm so sorry for the lost; I sent my condolences to the family. It's such a sad awareness
