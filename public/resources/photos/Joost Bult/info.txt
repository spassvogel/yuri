Yuriaan Smiley, amigo, I've been travelling again, a beautiful place, you would love it. Nature, mountains, sun, lovely people and great food. You are here with me.
I tear up when I see all the beautiful stories people share about you. I want to thank you Yuri, for all the magic you brought. I was a bit of a lost cat when I met you and the others from Leidschendam. You were one of my friends that helped me out of my shell, you showed me so much love, freedom and openness. I still can't believe we shared a bed for three months in India. Bang Bang Bangalore!
I miss you. I feel you. Your energy runs thru me.

I'll see you on the flipside.
Much love hermano
