Here I (the second from right) was in Psy-Fi festival. Next to me Merijn Hoogenstrijd and Irfaan Koerban. I was there to give a workshop and Yuri was the responsible and organiser of the cinema. We spend a lot of time together, camping, dancing and laughing. He also organised two sessions of dark meditation with music-therapy and I helped with playing and singing. Everything he organised was made with passion, devotion and always with a big smile. We took this picture the first day of the festival after we had an amazing night together, especially on the hill which is behind us. That special place and moment was the reason of this picture. We renamed it the Frog Spirit. Surely that night had something very deep to teach us and connect us all even deeper. The festival became a coherent continuation of such a starting point.
I knew him for few years already, how to not fall in love with his wonderful and peaceful smile. The connection was always strong and spontaneous because of many common interests and ideas. This festival was the first real adventure we shared together and needless to say how shocking is to know that it was also the last one, at least in this physical form.
I can add much more, but probably they would be things that you already know.
