Juriaan was my first Dutch friend, I met him in 2007 just after few days living and studying in the Netherlands. I was completely alone with 23years moving  to  a  different culture.  Since the first moment we became very close and he supported me on the process of adaptation. He shared  with my friends and all the people around me at the school . They all love him, My parents  met him and they were delighted by his open heart. After some years I got to understand that I was bless with an angel in Netherlands and it was him. He also introduce me to wonderful people which now are my friends  and I feel grateful about them. Tow  of his best friends are very important and special to me. Wouter and Marleen.. In 2012 I came back to my home country... but thousands of kilometers did not separate our souls because we always got in touch. We made skype calls some times of hours !  every time I came to NL we see each other. Before I came back home in 2012 we spent really nice time  in Amsterdam with my mother... it was awesome. My flight was very early and he was there helping me to Cary my luggage. It did not matter how early it was... He was just there. It's incredible that he was there even when my dad was in his process of dying of cancer and I was taking care of him. He skype with and my Dad and it was fun! With his positive energy I got stronger :)!!! Thanks God for him in my life. Thank you for Juriaan. Rest In Peace my Juri!
